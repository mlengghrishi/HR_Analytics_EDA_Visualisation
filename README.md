HR analytics (also known as people analytics) is the collection and application of talent data to improve critical talent and business outcomes. HR analytics leaders enable HR leaders to develop data-driven insights to inform talent decisions, improve workforce processes and promote positive employee experience. HR analytics is a fairly novel tool. This means it is still largely unexplored in scientific literature. The bestknown scientific HR analytics definition is by Heuvel & Bondarouk. According to them, HR analytics is the systematic identification and quantification of the people drivers of business outcomes.

b) Diagnostic:- It explains the “Why” of HR data. It gives a deeper analysis of descriptive data.

c) Predictive:- It explains "What will" of HR data. It uses statistical modeling to predict results. It  explains the trend that would occur in the future.

d) Prescriptive:- It guides to understand the HR data and provide evidence-based results. It uses simulation and optimization techniques.
